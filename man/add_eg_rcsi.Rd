\arguments{
\item{data}{dataset}

\item{rCSILessQlty}{Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to rely on less preferred and less expensive food to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?}

\item{rCSIBorrow}{Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to borrow food or rely on help from a relative or friend to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?}

\item{rCSIMealSize}{Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to limit portion size of meals at meal times to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?}

\item{rCSIMealAdult}{Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to restrict consumption by adults in order for small children to eat to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?}

\item{rCSIMealNb}{Column representing question - During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to reduce number of meals eaten in a day to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?}

\item{new_colname}{The prefix for the new columns. It has to be a string.}
