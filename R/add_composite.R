#' c("none", "little", "moderate", "severe", "very_severe")
#' @param hhs1a The name of the column "In the past 4 weeks (30 days), was there ever no food to eat
#' of any kind in your house because of lack of resources to get food?". It has to be a string.
#' @param hhs1b The name of the column "How often did this happen in the past (4 weeks/30 days)?".
#' It has to be a string.
#' @param hhs2a The name of the column "In the past 4 weeks (30 days), did you or any household
#' member go to sleep at night hungry because there was not enough food?". It has to be a string.
#' @param hhs2b The name of the column "How often did this happen in the past (4 weeks/30 days)?".
#' It has to be a string.
#' @param hhs3a The name of the column "In the past 4 weeks (30 days), did you or any household
#' member go a whole day and night without eating anything at all because there was not enough food?".
#' It has to be a string.
#' @param hhs3b The name of the column "How often did this happen in the past (4 weeks/30 days)?".
#' It has to be a string.
#' @param yesno_choice A vector of 2 strings from the choices for the yes/no set of questions in
#' this order: c("yes", "no")
