#' Add indicator for reduced Household CSI Score(rcsi)
#'
#' @param data dataset
#' @param rCSILessQlty Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to rely on less preferred and less expensive food to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?
#' @param rCSIBorrow   Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to borrow food or rely on help from a relative or friend to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?
#' @param rCSIMealSize Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to limit portion size of meals at meal times to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?
#' @param rCSIMealAdult Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to restrict consumption by adults in order for small children to eat to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?
#' @param rCSIMealNb Column representing question - During the last 7 days, were there days (and, if so, how many) when your household had to reduce number of meals eaten in a day to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?
#' @param new_colname The prefix for the new columns. It has to be a string.
